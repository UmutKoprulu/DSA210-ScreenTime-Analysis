Hypotheses:

H₀ (Null): There is no significant relationship between screen time (phone or computer) and either sleep duration or study time.

H₁ (Alternative): Increased screen time significantly reduces sleep duration and study time.

Results Summary:

Phone Usage vs. Sleep Duration: r = –0.36, p = 0.0249 → statistically significant negative correlation.

Phone Usage vs. Study Time: r = –0.36, p = 0.0238 → statistically significant negative correlation.

Computer Usage vs. Sleep Duration: r = –0.19, p = 0.2450 → no significant relationship.

Computer Usage vs. Study Time: r = –0.09, p = 0.5597 → no significant relationship.

Interpretation:
Because both phone–sleep and phone–study correlations are negative and have p < 0.05, we reject H₀ for smartphone usage. In other words, higher daily minutes spent on the phone are associated with significantly shorter nights of sleep and fewer hours spent studying. By contrast, computer screen time showed weak, non-significant correlations, so we do not have evidence that it meaningfully affects sleep or study time in this dataset.

Implications:
Limiting smartphone use—especially in the hours leading up to bedtime—could help preserve both sleep quantity and study productivity. Further work might explore whether reducing phone screen time by, say, 60 minutes per day reliably translates into measurable gains in rest and learning.
